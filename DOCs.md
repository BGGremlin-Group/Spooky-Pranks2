## Technical Notes
- **Implementation**: These pranks are coded using lightweight scripts (e.g., Python with PyWin32, AutoHotkey), leveraging Windows APIs for UI manipulation, sound playback, and visual effects (e.g., OpenGL for glitch/melt animations). All effects are temporary, stored in memory, and do not alter system files.
- **Safety**: No data is modified or deleted. All changes are cosmetic and reversible via key combos, hidden files, or rebooting.
- **Ethical Use**: See Readme
- **Visual Effects**: Glitch effects use pixelation/shader techniques; melting effects use warping animations; skull imagery is rendered as semi-transparent overlays.
