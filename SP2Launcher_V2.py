# Documentation: Spooky Pack 2 - 20 Harmless but Funny and Creepy Windows Viruses

## Overview
This document describes 20 fictional, harmless prank programs designed to simulate creepy and humorous "virus" effects on Windows systems. These programs are purely for entertainment, causing no permanent damage or data loss. Some include visual distortions like screen glitches, melting effects, or skull imagery for a spooky yet playful vibe. Each entry includes a description, behavior, visual effects (if applicable), and a "removal" method to ensure reversibility.

**Note**: These are fictional and intended for consensual pranks on personal test systems. Ethical programming practices are required to ensure no harm to systems or data.

## Technical Notes
- **Implementation**: These pranks are coded as lightweight Python scripts, using Windows APIs for UI manipulation, sound playback, and visual effects (e.g., PIL for glitch/melt animations). All effects are temporary, stored in memory, and do not modify system files.
- **Safety**: No data is altered or deleted. All changes are cosmetic and reversible via key combos, hidden files, or rebooting.
- **Ethical Use**: Deploy only on personal test systems or with user consent. Include clear exit instructions in a hidden README file.
- **Visual Effects**: Glitch effects use pixelation techniques; melting effects use warping animations; skull imagery is rendered as semi-transparent overlays.

## Disclaimer
These are fictional pranks for entertainment on personal test systems. Real-world deployment requires permission and must avoid distress or system harm. Always provide clear "removal" instructions to users.

## README: Ethical Usage and Instructions

### Usage Instructions
1. **Running the Launcher**: Execute this script (`launcher.py`) to access the interactive menu.
2. **Selecting a Virus**: Enter a number from 1 to 20 to run the corresponding prank virus, 7 for help (displays this documentation), 99 to launch all viruses simultaneously, 100 to launch all viruses sequentially at a user-defined interval, or 0 to exit. Multiple viruses can run concurrently.
3. **Virus Execution**: Each virus runs as a separate process. Use the removal instructions below to stop individual viruses.
4. **Safety**: All viruses are harmless, with no data loss or permanent changes. Effects are reversible via key combos, desktop shortcuts, or rebooting.

### Ethical Guidelines
- **Consent**: Only run these pranks on your own experimental system or with explicit permission from the user. Unauthorized use may cause distress or be unethical.
- **Transparency**: Since this is a personal test PC, ensure you understand the effects and removal methods. For others, inform users that the program is a prank and provide clear exit instructions.
- **No Harm**: Ensure the system remains functional. These scripts are designed to avoid modifying or deleting data.
- **Exit Instructions**: Each virus has a specific removal method (listed below). Ensure you know how to stop each prank.

### Removal Instructions
- **Virus 1**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + S` or run "ScrollFix.bat" from the desktop.
- **Virus 2**: Click a hidden "Restore" button in Task Manager or end "MeltManager.exe" in a secondary Task Manager instance.
- **Virus 3**: Right-click the desktop and select "Purge Icons" from a custom menu or reboot.
- **Virus 4**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + Flip` or run "RightSideUp.exe" from the desktop.
- **Virus 5**: Adjust screen brightness to max and back or run "GlowBanish.bat".
- **Virus 6**: Press Caps Lock five times in a row or end "CursedCaps.exe" in Task Manager.
- **Virus 7**: Open File Explorer and select "Cleanse Drive" from a custom menu or reboot.
- **Virus 8**: Type "CLEAR" in the search bar or run "SearchFix.exe".
- **Virus 9**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + Anchor` or run "WindowLock.bat".
- **Virus 10**: Open Display Settings and select "Restore Colors" from a custom option or reboot.
- **Virus 11**: Right-click a folder and select "Stabilize" from a custom menu or end "FlickerFolder.exe".
- **Virus 12**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + E` or run "EmojiBanish.exe".
- **Virus 13**: Click both mouse buttons simultaneously three times or run "MouseClean.bat".
- **Virus 14**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + Grid` or run "GridBanish.exe".
- **Virus 15**: Click "Dismiss All" on any notification or end "NotifyGhost.exe" in Task Manager.
- **Virus 16**: Right-click a shortcut and select "Freeze" from a custom menu or reboot.
- **Virus 17**: Press `Ctrl + Shift + Power` or run "PowerFix.bat".
- **Virus 18**: Paste "UNCURSE" into any text field or end "ClipCurse.exe" in Task Manager.
- **Virus 19**: Click "Exit Game" in the pop-up or run "GameBanish.exe".
- **Virus 20**: Open Sound Settings and select "Restore Sounds" from a custom option or run "SoundFix.bat".

### Notes
- Ensure all virus scripts (`virus_1.py` to `virus_20.py`) are in the same directory as this launcher.
- If a virus does not stop as expected, rebooting the system will terminate all effects.
- Running all 20 viruses simultaneously may strain an older PC. Monitor system performance and stop processes if needed.
- For support, refer to the documentation above or experiment safely on your test system.

**Disclaimer**: Use responsibly on your experimental PC. These pranks are for fun and must not be used to cause distress or harm.
